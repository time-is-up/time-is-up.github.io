Since it's a cubic equation, there are three roots in total, which could be real or complex. But the problem specifies that all roots must be real.\n\nOne approach to solving cubic equations is to try to factor them or use the rational root theorem to find possible rational roots. However, in this case, the coefficients are in terms of \\( a \\), which makes it a bit more complicated.\n\nLet me see if I can factor this polynomial. Looking at the equation:\n\n\\[ x^3 + a x^2 + a x + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nI notice that if I\n\n**Time's Up!**\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\boxed{[answer]}.",
