                "solution": "So I've got this problem here about Steve and Tim racing to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives farther away than Tim, 3 miles versus 2 miles, but Steve gets an advantage by biking, while Tim skates. I need to figure out how long the winner will have to wait for the loser to finish the race.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how long it takes each of them to get home. To do that, I'll need to use their speeds and the distances they have to cover.\n\nSteve lives 3 miles away and bikes at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away and skates at 264 feet per minute. But wait, the distances are in miles, and the speeds are in feet per minute. I need to make sure the units match. So, I should convert miles to feet.\n\nI know that 1 mile equals 5280 feet. So, Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 3 times 5280 feet, and Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 2 times 5280 feet.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nSteve's distance: 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet\n\nTim's distance: 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet\n\nNow, I can find the time each takes to get home by dividing the distance by their respective speeds.\n\nFor Steve:\n\nTime = distance / speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n15840 / 440 = 36 minutes\n\n\n\n**Time's Up!**\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\boxed{36}",

Steve's biking speed is 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

According to the problem, after redistributing the coins, each of the eight bags will have the same number of coins, so \\( 7x + 53 \\) must be divisible by 8. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 7x + 53 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 7x \\equiv -53 \\pmod{8} \\]\n\nSince \\(-53 \\equiv -53 + 64 = 11 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}\\), we can rewrite the congruence as:\n\n\\[ 7x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8.

                "solution": "&lt;think&gt\nOkay, so I have this problem where there are seven bags of gold coins, each with the same number of coins. Then I find an additional bag with 53 coins. I decide to redistribute all these coins so that all eight bags have the same number of coins. After redistributing, I note that I have more than 200 coins in total. The question is asking for the smallest number of coins I could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins.\n\nLet me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of coins in each of the original seven bags as \\( n \\). So, the total number of coins I had before finding the extra bag is \\( 7n \\).\n\nThen, I find a bag with 53 coins, so the total number of coins I have now is \\( 7n + 53 \\).\n\nNow, I want to redistribute all these coins into eight bags, each with the same number of coins. Let's denote the number of coins in each of the eight bags after redistribution as \\( m \\). Therefore, the total number of coins is also equal to \\( 8m \\).\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 7n + 53 = 8m \\]\n\nWe also know that after redistribution, the total number of coins is more than 200. So,\n\\[ 8m > 200 \\]\nWhich means,\n\\[ m > 25 \\]\n\nSince \\( m \\) has to be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a coin), the smallest possible value for \\( m \\) is 26.\n\nSo, substituting \\( m = 26 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 7n + 53 = 8 \\times 26 \\]\n\\[ 7n + 53 = 208 \\]\nSubtract 53 from both sides:\n\\[ 7n = 208 - 53 \\]\n\\[ 7n = 155 \\]\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\\[ n = \\frac{155}{7} \\]\nCalculating that, 7 goes into 155 how many times? 7*22=154, so 155/7 is 22 with a remainder of 1. So, \\( n = 22 \\) with a remainder of 1, which means \\( n \\) is not an integer. But \\( n \\) has to be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a coin in each bag.\n\nSo, \\( m = 26 \\) doesn't work because it results in \\( n \\) not being an integer. Therefore, we need to try the next integer value for \\( m \\), which is 27.\n\nSubstituting \\( m = 27 \\):\n\\[ 7n + 53 = 8 \\times 27 \\]\n\\[ 7n + 53 = 216 \\]\nSubtract 53:\n\\[ 7n = 216 - 53 \\]\n\\[ 7n = 163 \\]\nDivide by 7:\n\\[ n = \\frac{163}{7} \\]\nCalculating that, 7*23=161, so 163/7 is 23 with a remainder of 2. Again, \\( n \\) is not an integer. So, \\( m = 27 \\) also doesn't work.\n\nNext, try \\( m = 28 \\):\n\\[ 7n + 53 = 8 \\times 28 \\]\n\\[ 7n + 53 = 224 \\]\nSubtract 53:\n\\[ \n\n**Time's Up!**\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\boxed{155}\n&lt;/think&gt\n\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of coins in each of the original seven",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you have to use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but since these are trinomials, it'll be a bit more involved. I think the best way is to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.
